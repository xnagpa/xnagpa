# Welcome to my github!
## My passion is creating tiny tools and scripts that solve small but annoying tasks

Here they are: 

- Creepy Media, Creepymedia is a collection of scary stories from all over the internet [Creepy Media]
- For those, who use splendid Anki application for studying. Add new cards to your deck right from Chrome while browsing. Install my simple and yet powerful Chrome plugin! [Anki Adder Simple ] 
- Your designer keeps using 20 shades of gray and you are tired of mapping them to the gray colors that you use in your project. Use my tool to find the closest color to the given one!  [Find the closest color]
- Tired of dull manual labor writing styled components? Use my [JSX to StyledComponents] tool to reduce the amount of manual labor!
- You have a tree-like structure and you have to call a certain function on each node of that tree? Use my [forEachTreeNode] snippet. Usage example included.
